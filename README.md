# Kickstarter-Analysis Excel

# Overview of Project
 
# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to is to compare the results of fundraising campaigns based on their Outcomes, Launch Date and Statistics. We specifically worked on number of successful, canceled numbers and total projects.

# Analysis and Challenges
Before we are starting the analysis, we can see that the data supported and organized by many ways, including the description, status and goal of the campaign, amount pledged, average amount of donation, category and subcategory and the dates in which the campaigns begin and ended. Analysis achieved and filtered by the theater and play trends.

Now! Letâ€™s start to explain those analysis steps together.

# Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this section, I created a pivot table that filtered the outcomes by category and the launch date. The columns show us the status of the campaign and the row shows the months during the campaign. This allows us to see the total count of successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns. Please see picture below for results.

# Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To analyze the Outcomes Based on Goals, in this section I created a table that received the total number of campaigns based on filters. I used Countifs function to get correct numbers. Wit this function I have filtered campaign goal, category and subcategory and the outcomes.

When I complete the analysis, I find results for successful, failed, and canceled campaigns goals for each colomns. Please see picture below for details;

# Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Most challenges of Kickstarter sheet is a COUNTIFS statement. Filtering the data by plays, it would be automatically becoming a criteria for the chart. Which is this way I guaranteed that I will only receive the play campaigns conclusion.

# Results
# Outcomes Based on Launch Date Results
The line chart picture as shown, we can tell May is the best month to start a theater campaign will be highest amount of successful outcomes.  We can say December is not the best month to lunch a theater campaign, in this direction we can see results are lowest number of successful outcomes.  In month of December, successful and failed campaigns are almost equal.

# Outcomes Based on Launch Date Explanation
Although the pattern fluctuates, it is apparent that play campaigns with higher goals tend to have a greater percent chance of failing. We can see that there is a subtle decrease among campaign success as the goal amount becomes larger and larger. However, there is an anomaly at about $35,000, in which we see a sharp increase in the success rate and sharp decrease in failure rate.

# Outcomes Based on Goals Explanation
Some of the limitations on the dataset may include incomplete data. Although the data is complete for each campaign that is inputted in our spreadsheet, we may have missing data for campaigns that were never recorded. Additionally, we do have a few outliers within the dataset. Without further analysis, we are currently unable to determine the cause of these outliers.
