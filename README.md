# Overview of Project
 
# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to is to compare the results of fundraising campaigns based on their Outcomes, Launch Date and Statistics. We specifically worked on number of successful, canceled numbers and total projects.

# Analysis and Challenges
Before we are starting the analysis, we can see that the data supported and organized by many ways, including the description, status and goal of the campaign, amount pledged, average amount of donation, category and subcategory and the dates in which the campaigns begin and ended. Analysis achieved and filtered by the theater and play trends.
Now! Letâ€™s start to explain couple of those analysis steps together.

# Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this section, I created a pivot table that filtered the outcomes by category and the launch date. The columns show us the status of the campaign and the row shows the months during the campaign. This allows us to see the total count of successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns. Please see picture below for results.

# Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To analyze the Outcomes Based on Goals, I created a table that retrieved the total number of campaigns based off of certain criteria. In order to retrieve the correct count, the COUNTIFS statement was used. Within this formula, I set multiple criteria, including a range for the desired campaign goal, the specific category, and the outcomes of these campaigns. In this case, we wanted to look at the subcategory, plays.

# Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges that I encountered was forgetting to include a criteria within the COUNTIFS statement. Originally, I thought that filtering the data by plays would automatically become a criteria for the chart. However, this was not the case. Instead of filtering from the Kickstarter sheet, I had to include it as a criterion within the COUNTIFS statement. This guaranteed that I would retrieved only the play campaigns.

# Results
Outcomes Based on Launch Date Conclusions
From the line chart, we can see that the best month to start a theater campaign is in May as it produces the highest amount of successful outcomes. Similarly, we can infer that December would not be the best month to launch a theater campaign, as it has the lowest number of successful outcomes. In fact, the number of successful campaigns is almost equivalent to the number of failed campaigns during the month of December.

# Outcomes Based on Launch Date Explanation
Although the pattern fluctuates, it is apparent that play campaigns with higher goals tend to have a greater percent chance of failing. We can see that there is a subtle decrease among campaign success as the goal amount becomes larger and larger. However, there is an anomaly at about $35,000, in which we see a sharp increase in the success rate and sharp decrease in failure rate.

# Outcomes Based on Goals Explanation
Some of the limitations on the dataset may include incomplete data. Although the data is complete for each campaign that is inputted in our spreadsheet, we may have missing data for campaigns that were never recorded. Additionally, we do have a few outliers within the dataset. Without further analysis, we are currently unable to determine the cause of these outliers.
